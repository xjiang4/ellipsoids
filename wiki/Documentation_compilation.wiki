#summary Describes a software needed and a sequence of steps a developer should follow in order to compile documentation.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Installing software =

At first, you need to install _Sphinx_ according to [http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html this instruction]. Sphinx goes as a package for _Python_, which installation is also described on a page above. Better install _Python_ version 2.7.`*`. The latest _Sphinx_ version by the moment when this instruction was written had been 1.2b3. You will also need _Sphinx_ package for numbering figures called _numfig_, which latest version can be downloaded [http://sourceforge.net/p/numfig/wiki/Home/ here]. Untar downloaded tarball, open _Command Prompt_ and go to the directory with the `*`.py files from this tarball, then type: `python setup.py install`.

= Compilation =

To compile documentation, you need to open _Windows PowerShell_, go to the main directory of the project, which is /doc/ and:
  * to get _HTML_ version, run `.\make html`,
  * to get _LaTeX_ version, run `.\make latexpdf`. To get _PDF_ out from the _LaTeX_ sources, you need  the latest version of _MiKTeX_ to be installed (can be downloaded from [http://miktex.org/download here]). Better choose to install packages on-the-fly when asked during the installation. When installation is finished, reboot the computer. To get PDF, open Command Prompt, go to the doc\_build\latex, type `pdflatex elltool_manual.tex` and then once again run this command to get references fixed. 

Documentation structure is defined in main_manual.rst, some of the additional features can be set in conf.py.
