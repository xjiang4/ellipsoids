#summary This page describes a workflow  of issues (tasks, enhancements, bug reports) for the project

Here and below we use a term "ticket" as a synonym of any type of issue including tasks, enhancements, bug reports etc created in the google issue tracker.

= Enhancement workflow and branching/merging policty =

  # Enhancement is created by a project owner and assigned to a developer with "New" status
  # Once developer starts working on an issue he/she 
     # changes the status to "Started". 
     # creates a branch using the following name patter *issue_33_bgates* or *issue_33_bill_gates*
     # starts making the changes withi his/her branch
     
  # Once the source code is written, the latest changes from trunk are integrated into the branch and ALL tests pass (not just the newly written tests but ALL of them a developer goes to "issues" tab and creates a new issue using "Review request". This review request is assigned to a person who created the original issue. If the reviewer concludes that the task is ready then the reviewer notifies the developer that the task is ready for reintegration to trunk. Notification can be done in two ways
     # via comment in the original ticket
     # via reassigning back the request review ticket

 the developer does the following:
     # get the latest changes from the trunk AGAIN (because review could take time and during that time trunk could have been changed again)
     # run all the tests again
     # if everything is ok - reintegrate his/her branch back to trunk, if not - make the necessary changes to resolve the conflicts, fix the tests. If the changes are substantial - a review by the original task submitter is needed again. If the changes are very small - reintegration to trunk is allowed.
     # once reintegration is done, the branch is deleted by a developer and the issue status is changed to "Fixed"
